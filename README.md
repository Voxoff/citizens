## A tech test for Citizens Advice

Completed as per criteria outlined in the Technical Assessment. The following requirement is still to be completed: "The API also needs to allow a user token that is up to 2 hours old to be exchanged for a fresh user token."

Please bear in mind that my RSpec knowledge is a work in progress.
